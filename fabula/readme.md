## A Quick Introduction

Ah... project Fabula \(latin for story\). You know something? I believe we all have a story to share, something that no one else can ever create the way we initially create it. Sure we might based it off something else, but our own interpretations will always be unique. This is my quick introduction into how I came to decided I needed/**need** to make this.

When I finally discovered how to read Mark Down \(shocking right, I said read instead of write\), I noticed that it would be interesting if I could create my own spin on it. But then the idea went away and eventually I felt like writing again. When I did I found it annoying to style my writing as I had to make on spot decisions on how I would like to go about styling it. Whether I wanted this part to be in a letter, a sign, a book/journal entry that I started to miss MarkDown. So I did some research and I found [Fountain.io](https://www.fountain.io) but it was for screen writing. So now I'm basically trying to write in that way, and I gotta say it's strange and difficult because it's not what I want. What I want is to write once, share everywhere. Is that hard? Yes. Why? This includes turning it into a video game that's why! Sorry for yelling...

Then I decided that Markdown was good, but not good enough. I need an amp up version, something like HTML, JSON maybe JavaScript to help me accomplish it. Why them? The same reason I also want XML and YAML to help me accomplish this. I want it to be cross-platform and easy to use and run. In the end, I want a syntax that will turn my writing into variables, classes and files so that I can export it any way I see fit. Whether it's a book, movie, animation, play or game.

But before I do, I need to understand everything that goes into a book. The spark that made the story, the process to develop a good idea into a great execution. What I need to do is to read, and to write. Learn what and how people managed to create in word, fountain and html \(epub\). Then I can see what I need.

### What I need

1. Character Development Timeline
2. Story Progression Timeline
3. Character Family Tree
4. World Web \(A Web showing how people interact. Includes every character in the world\)
5. A World Map \(A Map Constructing how the world looks and operates, including a timeline\)
6. A Character Chart \(Action, Dialogue, Events\)
7. An Item Chart \(Name, Description, Attributes, Functions\)
8. TO BE DECIDED

### How I Will Go About It

1. Create the Syntax
2. Create the parser \(makes it readable\)
3. Create the templates
4. Create the compiler \(makes it function\)
5. Create the user interface \(basic functions\)
6. Create the add-on\(s\) \(basically everything from "what I need"\)
7. Create a website \(to share, distribute, promote, the community, etc.\)
8. Get feedback, ideas, preferences
9. Improve my creation
10. Decentralize it
