# Cody

## A Quick Introduction

I'm not the most organized individual, and as such I need help to become and to stay organized. If you take a look at my bookmarks, yours too maybe. Then you'll see all the many websites, articles etc. that you've marked to come back to one day. For this reason, I need to create Cody.

### What Will Cody Do?

1. Allow the Creation of a Bookmark \(Website, Article, Image-link\)
2. Import Your Current Bookmarks from your desktop\(s\) and browsers \(Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Chromium\)
3. Sync your current and new Bookmarks between devices by sharing information between the browser and the app \(with or without an extension\)
4. Store your information within the Block Stack Block-chain for security, or a user chosen storage method \(Dropbox, Drive, Mega, One-drive, etc.\)

### Additional Features

* Show Images instead of link
* Switch Between List View and Item View
* Add Folders, and sub-folders
* Add image import for custom appearance \(folders and bookmarks\)
* Add a tagging system
* Add a category system
* Add a search system 
  * with filters\(Titles, Tags, Categories, subtitles\)
* Add a title \(Main Website Title\) for links and a subtitle \(User Defined Title\)
* Add a description option
* Add a drag and drop interface
* Add a work space option \(Personal Bookmarks, Work, Education\)
  * only syncs when told to
  * syncs to specific browser
* Add a user option \(multiple users on one "account"/system\)
  * A sign in, sign out, switch users - for shared computers

### How I will Do It

1. Create the bookmark creation, importing, and exporting foundation.
2. Integrate with File Storage for Cloud Storage, or Local Storage
3. Create a user friendly User Interface \(Basic File structure\)
4. Create an Extension to help smooth out the Desktop Experience
5. Integrate with Block Stack
6. Create a sharing feature that will work with mobile browsers \(from app to and fro browser\)
7. Add additional features
8. Gain Feedback
9. Fix or improve based on feedback
