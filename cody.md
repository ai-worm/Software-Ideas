# Cody

## A Quick Introduction

I'm not the most organized individual, and as such I need help to become and to stay organized. If you take a look at my bookmarks, yours too maybe. Then you'll see all the many websites, articles etc. that you've marked to come back to one day. For this reason, I need to create Cody.

### What Will Cody Do?

1. Allow the Creation of a Bookmark \(Website, Article, Image-link\)
2. Import Your Current Bookmarks from your desktop\(s\) and browsers \(Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, Chromium\)
3. Sync your current and new Bookmarks between devices by sharing information between the browser and the app \(with or without an extension\)
4. Store your information within the Block Stack Block-chain for security, or a user chosen storage method \(Dropbox, Drive, Mega, One-drive, etc.\)
