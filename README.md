  We all love software and there are hundreds of applications out there that we
  haven't even heard about, while some doesn't even exist. This is a
  documentation for the software I would love to create.

# Software-Ideas

## A Quick Introduction

Sometimes we need ideas. Other times, we have to many ideas and would like for others to help us out. This is why I created this little repository, and even added a license to it lol. Now that I think about it, shouldn't it have been a Creative Common License or something similar instead of the MIT ðŸ¤” ... maybe. Oh well, maybe I'll change it later who knows. As of right now not many people aren't reading this. Maybe I should introduce myself so that it's easier to understand why I did this.

### Who Am I?

That's a good question. Who am I? What are my dreams? My goals? My past, present and future? What makes me different from everyone else and yet so similar? Well if I wanted to answer that question I would have asked, "Who are we?"

I'm just a guy who wants to create, and if you all would like to help me then be my guest. I have always been the type of person with his head in the cloud, or more specifically, looking out the window. There is just too many what if's, and I just want to get started on them. But I also understand that I might never finish them, or that I might run out of time, interest, patience, skills, knowledge or I just plain out bit more than I could chew. Either way, there is bound to be someone out there with a similar goal in mind, or goals that is :D. I love to dream big y'all.

### How Does This Work?

Easy, any ideas posted here have to be released on a **MIT License**, **Creative Common** \(with or without attribution, including free for commercial\) or another similar one. I leave that "another similar one" to be interpreted by anyway you wish \(think big, or be a nice guy like me who is to soft for his own good, not both unlike me sometimes\).

Yikes, I know it may sound harsh to some. But trust me, this is for the best. After all, what do you want to happen to everything you worked so hard for? For some random folk to come along and own everything you did? Or for them to be screwed because its also free for everyone else? That may not be the best example, but hey it work's 80% of the time \(said by me and no one ever\).

### What I Will Do

Okay, so anything posted on here has to go for free is that correct? Yes. Okay then, that means that the way this will work is that anything that I post here will be published under my favorite "non-existing" organization [Allinventor](https://github.com/Allinventor). Everything there will be posted under the MIT Software License for anyone to use, including me. See what I did there? That's how it works if you know that someone might change your idea into something you might have not originally wanted or planned for. It makes me feel more empowered towards my own set of goals.

Everything I post under my personal account on [Github](https://github.com/ai-worm) will be up to me to decide what type of license to give it. But a majority of the time it will still be a MIT License as I will either fork it from my organization, transfer ownership and then fork it or I just don't know what to do with it.

### What You Should Do

Notice that this is a should, and not a must. I would like for my organization to grow, as I want people creating around it. Personally I want the organization to be managed by a small group who work together to bring ideas to life, while the community helps improve it through varies ways \(memes included :D\), or just plain use it. If all goes well, there should exist an option for you to directly contact them, pace your ideas, feedback etc.

You can submit your version of the project to the organization so that they can post it \(aka promote it\), transfer ownership \(which if you do, then you have to be integrated to the organization as it wouldn't have been possible without you. -is this a new rule?Hmm... might be\) or just plain enjoy it. Honestly if you use my ideas or someone else it's always good to share.

**Share your work**. That is all I really want you to do, and that really is what you should do. How and why you do it should be up to you, after all we all love attention every once in a while. We really should support one another, because if you don't then who will support you?

### Final Thoughts

If you read this long then you are free to share your ideas here. But how you may ask? Well it's simple. Simply create a new folder with your name, your idea name or your online identity. And it create a file that states what you want your idea to accomplish \(at least one goal\), how you would like for it go about it and most importantly what type of technology \(API's, programming languages, block-chain, etc.\) you would like integrated into your idea. And if you do create it, make sure to link it there as well, just like the person who sees it and makes it. Simple right? I just want a community of those who want to create but don't have everything they need to in order to accomplish it. Also, if there are any guidelines to your idea make sure to include it in the file, your name too if you want.

As a side note, the main "source" project will be under my personal account. But hey, there should also be one under my organization. This one is really for my personal ideas, contributions etc. It's just meant to help me put my thoughts in order. This is how I will start out creating software. I just needed a way to stay organized.
